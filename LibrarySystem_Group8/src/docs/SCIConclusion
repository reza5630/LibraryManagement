Describe two of the SCI principles that you relate to your Library System project work.

For CS401 course we had to build a Library Management System that comes with multiple features related to library books and the members. While working in the project we came to realize that even a library system that we have been using our whole life is also based on the principles that we’ve learnt from our STC course. The way we designed our library system works in different layers. Users make queries in the user interface, the request goes to the controller logic system, that finally retries the information from the database and presents properly to the user. Implementations like this is proved to be very efficient if we are to add more features in the future, that follows a useful and efficient design pattern. These necessary things about design pattern makes so much sense when we learn more about SCI principles like, Outer layer depends on inner, Purification leads to progress, Order is present in everywhere.
